                <h2>A Pizza Made By An Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
                <p>There are numerous ways to go about making pizza but out of the ones I have seen, I cannot say I have run into one written by someone who wants to be a web developer.
                   It makes sense given in general, tutorials are given by people who feel that they know enough to teach others on their craft and I cannot say I have seen a pizza making tutorial among
                   a playlist of web development courses.
                   While I am definitely not a professional baker, two things I really enjoy in life are web development and pizza so I figured why not combine the two using this webpage.
                   Here I share my method for making pizza and as you will see, it is likely very different from other tutorials available online.

            <h2>Preparing The Yeast</h2>
            <aside>This will take approximately 30 minutes.</aside>
            <p>Boil some tap water in a kettle over a stove set on high.
               Once the water has come to a boil, pour it into a small rice bowl about 1/4 of the way full as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-3">Figure 3</a>.
            </p>
            <figure id="Figure-3">

            </figure>
            <p>Leave the water to cool down for about 8 minutes.
               Add one teaspoon of sugar into the small rice bowl and stir.
            </p>
            <aside>The sugar will act as food for the yeast.</aside>
            <p>Wait for 1 minute and then add 1 &frac12; teaspoons of yeast into the small rice bowl.
               Stir the small rice bowl until the yeast dissolves as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-4">Figure 4</a>.
            </p>
            <aside>It is normal to observe bubbles and some of the yeast clustering together.</aside>
            <p>Cover the small rice bowl with a small plate and wait between 10 and 15 minutes.
               Remove the small plate from the top of the small rice bowl and you should notice the yeast has risen as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-5">Figure 5</a>.

            <h2>Making The Dough</h2>
            <aside>This step should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</aside>
            <p>Add 6 soup spoon's worth of All-purpose flour into a large bowl.
               Next, add 1 tea spoon of salt.
               Stir the contents using a pair of chopsticks.
            </p>
            <aside>Do not add salt directly to the small rice bowl containing your yeast-sugar-water mixture as this would kill the yeast.</aside>
            <p>Pour the contents of the small rice bowl from the previous section into the large bowl.
               Add warm water to the small rice bowl until it is full.
               Stir the warm water in the small rice bowl to collect the yeast which has clung to the bowl.
               Pour the contents into the large bowl.
               Add one tea spoon of olive oil into the large bowl.
               Mix the large bowl contents using a pair of chopsticks until the dough begins to form.
            </p>
            <aside>If the dough seems to be really wet and does not form, more soup spoons of all-purpose flour one spoonful at a time until the dough forms.</aside>
            </section>
            <section id="Kneading-And-The-Dough-Bounces-Back">
            <h2>Kneading And The Dough Bounces Back</h2>
            <aside>This step should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</aside>
            <p>Add a soup spoonful of all-purpose flour onto the cutting board and spread it out.
               Remove the dough from the large bowl and put the dough onto the cutting board.
               Knead the dough on the cutting board.
               To knead the dough, what you are effectively doing is folding the dough on itself and pushing on it repeatedly.
               Below you will find a short video which demonstrates this process.
            </p>
            <video controls>

                Sorry, your browser does not support embedded videos.
            </video>
            <p>In general you will want to knead the dough for 10 minutes but a better indicator of when to stop is by poking the dough.
               When you poke the dough, if it bounces back then you know you have kneaded enough.
            </p>
            <p>Once you have finished kneading the dough add one tea spoon of olive oil into the large bowl.
               Using your finger, spread the olive oil evenly throughout the bowl.
            </p>
            <aside>The olive oil keeps the dough from sticking to the bowl.</aside>
            <p>Place the dough into the large bowl.
               Cover the bowl with a large cloth.
