# Phamtastic Pizza
## Overview
This webpage was designed with a mobile-first approach, taking into consideration factors such as appropriate image resolution to minimize bandwidth usage and layout on a smaller screen.
This was accomplished by developing with the *Responsive Design Mode* availabe in the Mozilla Firefox developer tools to simulate the viewport of the Galaxy S9.
Flexible layouts are achieved using a combination of Flexbox and media queries for larger screens.
The webpage itself is hosted using GitHub Pages and you can access it by clicking [here](https://tonypham04.github.io/).

## Why Phamtastic Pizza?
In terms of nomenclature it is a play on words (fantastic but replace 'fan' with my family name 'Pham').
This is a personal project made primarily for fun but it also served as a great way to practice some web development fundamentals like HTML and CSS while also combining two things I enjoy quite a bit namely,
pizza and web development.

## Next Steps
Currently the images on the webpage are optimal for viewing on mobile device.
At the moment however, these same images are also being used on larger screens.
The next steps in this project will involve applying responsive images to the project so that at larger viewports the image resolution is correspondingly higher.
This will likely be achieved using the "srcset" attribute in a future update.
