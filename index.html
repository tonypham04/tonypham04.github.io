                <h2>A Pizza Made By An Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
                <p>There are numerous ways to go about making pizza but out of the ones I have seen, I cannot say I have run into one written by someone who wants to be a web developer.
                   It makes sense given in general, tutorials are given by people who feel that they know enough to teach others on their craft and I cannot say I have seen a pizza making tutorial among
                   a playlist of web development courses.
                   While I am definitely not a professional baker, two things I really enjoy in life are web development and pizza so I figured why not combine the two using this webpage.
                   Here I share my method for making pizza and as you will see, it is likely very different from other tutorials available online.
