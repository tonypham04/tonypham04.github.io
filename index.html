                <h2>A Pizza Made By An Aspiring Web Developer</h2>
                <p>There are numerous ways to go about making pizza but out of the ones I have seen, I cannot say I have run into one written by someone who wants to be a web developer.
                   It makes sense given in general, tutorials are written by people who feel that they know enough to teach others on their craft and I cannot say I have seen a pizza making tutorial among
                   a playlist of web development courses.
                   While I am definitely not a professional baker, two things I really enjoy in life are web development and pizza so I figured, why not combine the two using this webpage.
                </p>
                <p>Now you may be wondering, what makes a pizza <span>Phamtastic</span>?
                   For one, it is a play on words where I basically replace the &ldquo;fan&rdquo; in the word &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; with my surname, namely &ldquo;Pham&rdquo;.
                   In addition, what I consider to be <span>Phamtastic Pizza</span> is any pizza using my method of making it.
                   As you will soon see, my approach has a number of different methods and items used in the actual process which you likely have not seen elsewhere (or at least I have not seen elsewhere).
                </p>
                <aside>The overall process should take around 3 hours to complete.</aside>
                <p>With all that being said, let's take a look at how to make a Phamtastic Pizza. Enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Preparing The Yeast</h2>
            <aside>This step should take approximately 30 minutes to complete.</aside>
            <p>Boil some tap water in a kettle over a stove set on high.
               Once the water has come to a boil, pour it into a small rice bowl about &frac14 of the way full as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-3">Figure 3</a>.
            </p>
            <figure id="Figure-3">
                <img src="images/mobile/water-amount.png" alt="Photo showing approximately how much water should be in the small rice bowl">
                <figcaption>Figure 3. Visual of the amount of water you should be adding to the small rice bowl.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Leave the water to cool down for about 8 minutes.
               Add 1 teaspoon of sugar into the small rice bowl and stir.
            </p>
            <aside>The sugar will act as food for the yeast.</aside>
            <p>Wait for 1 minute and then add 1 &frac12; teaspoons of yeast into the small rice bowl.
               Stir the small rice bowl until the yeast dissolves as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-4">Figure 4</a>.
            </p>
            <aside>It is normal to observe bubbles and some of the yeast clustering together.</aside>
            <p>Cover the small rice bowl with a small plate and wait between 10 and 15 minutes checking on it every now and then.
               What you will notice is the yeast will rise up from inside the small rice bowl.
            </p>
               <aside>Do not leave the yeast unattended beyond 15 minutes because from my experience at that point if the plate is still on top of the small rice bowl the yeast will rise to the point where it touches
                the base of the small plate and stick to it.</aside>
               <p>Remove the small plate from the top of the small rice bowl and you should notice the yeast has risen as shown in <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-5">Figure 5</a>.</p>

            <h2>Making The Dough</h2>
            <aside>This step should take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</aside>
            <p>Add 6 soup spoons of all-purpose flour into a large bowl.
               Next, add 1 teaspoon of salt.
               Stir the contents using a pair of chopsticks.
            </p>
            <aside>Do not add salt directly to the small rice bowl containing your yeast-sugar-water mixture as this would kill the yeast.</aside>
            <p>Pour the contents of the small rice bowl from the previous section into the large bowl.
               Add warm water to the small rice bowl until it is full.
               Stir the warm water in the small rice bowl to collect the yeast which has clung to the bowl.
               Pour the contents into the large bowl.
               Add one teaspoon of olive oil into the large bowl.
               Mix the large bowl contents using a pair of chopsticks until the dough begins to form.
            </p>
            <aside>If the dough seems to be really wet and does not form, add more soup spoons of all-purpose flour one spoonful at a time until the dough forms.</aside>
            </section>
            <section id="Kneading-And-The-Dough-Bounces-Back">
            <h2>Kneading And The Dough Bounces Back</h2>
            <aside>This step should take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</aside>
            <p>Add &frac14; soup spoonful of all-purpose flour onto the cutting board and spread it out.
               Remove the dough from the large bowl and put the dough onto a cutting board.
               Knead the dough on the cutting board.
               To knead the dough, what you are effectively doing is folding the dough on itself and pushing on it.
               Below you will find a short video which demonstrates this process.
            </p>
            <div class="flex-container center-container">

                Sorry, your browser does not support embedded videos.
            </video>
            </div>
            <p>In general you will want to knead the dough for 10 minutes but a better indicator of when to stop is by poking the dough.
               When you poke the dough, if it bounces back then you know you have kneaded enough.
            </p>
            <p>Once you have finished kneading the dough add 1 teaspoon of olive oil into the large bowl.
               Using your finger, spread the olive oil evenly throughout the bowl.
            </p>
            <aside>The olive oil keeps the dough from sticking to the bowl.</aside>
            <p>Place the dough into the large bowl.
               Cover the bowl with a large cloth.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Rising-Of-The-Dough">
            <h2>Rising Of The Dough</h2>
            <aside>This step should take between 45 and 60 minutes to complete.
                What I have noticed is, on warmer days like during the summer the dough will rise faster than on colder days like during winter.
            </aside>
            <p>Now you need to wait for the dough to rise.
               In the meantime, you can start preparing what will go on top of your Phamtastic Pizza.
            </p>
            </section>
            <section id="Grating-Cheese-And-Preparing-Your-Toppings">
            <h2>Grating Cheese And Preparing Your Toppings</h2>
            <aside>Time will depend on what toppings you would like on your pizza and how long it takes to prepare them.
                   For myself, I like sliced sausage so this process takes around 10 minutes for me to complete.
            </aside>
            <p>If you have not done so already, clear off the excess flour on the cutting board.
               Using a pair of scissors remove the packaging for a block of cheese. (You could simply use your hands but I find using scissors is easier).
               Take a knife and cut out &frac13; of the block of cheese.
               Put away the remaining &frac23; as it will not be used on the Phamtastic Pizza.
               Place a cheese grater on the cutting board and grate the cheese.
            </p>
            <aside>If you happen to have a clean bag handy like the clear ones you can find in the produce section, you can use that under the cheese grater to collect the resulting shredded cheese.</aside>
            <p>After you have finished grating the cheese, move it somewhere else like on a small plate.
               If you opted to collect the shredded cheese into a clean bag for example you do not need to move it to a small plate.
               You just need to ensure the shredded cheese is not on the cutting board as you will need it for the dough.
            </p>
            <p>Now it is time to prepare your toppings.
               If you would like to follow along with what I like, place a sausage on the cutting board and slice it into thin slices using a knife.
               Place the resulting slices onto a small plate.
            </p>

            <section id="Putting-It-All-Together">
            <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
            <aside>This process should take approximately 25 minutes to complete. You can see what my pre-bake result looks like by referring to <a class="figure-link" href="#Figure-6">Figure 6</a>.</aside>
            <p>Cut out a sheet of aluminum foil and place it over your cutting board.
               The length of the sheet of aluminum foil should be slightly larger than the length of your pizza but not larger than the width of your oven or toaster oven.
            </p>
            <aside>To determine the best size for the aluminum foil what I do is measure it out according to the size of the cutting board.</aside>
            <p>Add a &frac14; soup spoon of all-purpose flour onto the aluminum foil and spread it out as evenly as you can.</p>
            <aside>This will help prevent the pizza from sticking to the aluminum foil.</aside>
            <p>Flip the large bowl containing the risen dough onto the aluminum foil, thus removing the dough from the large bowl.
               Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough into a flat circle (or in my case an oval-rectangle hybrid).
               Take a fork and gently poke holes throughout the dough avoiding the areas which would be where the crust is.
               Place a cloth over the flattened dough and wait for 10 minutes.
               In the meantime, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil into a small bowl.
            </p>
            <p>After 10 minutes have passed, remove the cloth from the dough.
               Dip a pastry brush into the small bowl containing olive oil.
               Gently brush over what would be the pizza crust.
               Add 2 tablespoons of pasta sauce (or tomato sauce if you prefer) onto the dough and spread it out evenly using the tablespoon.
               Next, add the cheese you shredded earlier onto the sauce covered dough as evenly as you can.
               Finally, add your toppings (in my case it would be the sliced sausage).

            <h2>Baking The Pizza</h2>
            <aside>This process should take approximately 35 minutes to complete.</aside>
            <p>Preheat a toaster oven (or regular oven) to 375&deg;F.</p>
            <aside>If you are using a toaster oven like me, you can do this by setting the baking timer to 35 minutes and waiting 5 minutes before placing the Phamtastic Pizza inside.
                   Alternatively, you could set the baking timer to 5 minutes and then to 30 minutes after you have placed your Phamtastic Pizza in the toater oven. 
            </aside>
            <p>Lift the cutting board holding your Phamtastic Pizza and carefully place the Phamtastic Pizza into your oven by grabbing onto an edge of the aluminum foil and slowly pulling it forward into the oven.</p>
            <aside>It really helps if you have someone to hold the cutting board for you while you do this.</aside>
            <p>Once the pizza is done, carefully remove it from the oven and place it onto a cutting board.
               Carefully remove the aluminum foil from the bottom of the Phamtastic Pizza.
            </p>
            <aside>You can use a pizza cutter to help you with this by moving it back and forth under the pizza to separate it from the aluminum foil.</aside>
